**An Oriented Object API Project for PHP**

This is a simple Api that processes a pile of cards to return clear and orderly instructions on a traveler's journey.

All data processing is done in the DataRanger.php class, which returns via its sortData method the expected ordered list.

Go to the url http://localhost/my_property_test/index.php to see the rendering for a dataset defined in index.php.
